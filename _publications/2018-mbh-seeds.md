title: "The Role of Gravitational Recoil in the Assembly of Massive Black Hole Seeds"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-mbh-seeds
excerpt: 'Massive black hole mergers release linear and angular momentum in the form of gravitational waves in a preferred direction due to asymmetries in the binary system.  This release imparts a gravitational recoil kick to the merged system, which can reach up to thousands of kilometers per second.  We study the role of gravitational recoil in the assembly of massive black hole seeds in the first billion years of the Universe.'

The detection of quasars at redshifts 6 and beyond indicate that the first black holes formed early and grew to a million to a billion times the mass of the Sun within the first billion years after the Big Bang.  We study the demographics of direct collapse massive black hole seed formation sites in the context of a cosmological SPH+N-body simulation with self-consistent, time-dependent, non-uniform Lyman-Werner radiation.
