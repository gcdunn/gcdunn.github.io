title: "The Role of Gravitational Recoil in the Assembly of Massive Black Hole Seeds"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-mbh-recoil
excerpt: 'Massive black hole mergers release linear and angular momentum in the form of gravitational waves in a preferred direction due to asymmetries in the binary system.  This release imparts a gravitational recoil kick to the merged system, which can reach up to thousands of kilometers per second.  We study the role of gravitational recoil in the assembly of massive black hole seeds in the first billion years of the Universe.'
