Introduction to Astronomy Laboratory
======
From Fall 2014 to Spring 2017, I served as a teaching assistant for the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Vanderbilt University.  Each semester, I lead one section of the laboratory component of Vanderbilt's undergraduate-level introductory astronomy course.  This course covered topics including celestial motion, spectroscopy, extrasolar planet detection, stellar photometry, basic telescope operation, and night sky observation.
