title: "Efficiently tuning topic models"
excerpt: "In natural language processing, topic models are used to extract meaningful and human-interpretable topics from a corpus.  However, tuning topic models for large corpora can be time consuming and computationally expensive.  By monitoring topic coherence as a function of corpus size, we can determine how to efficiently create a high quality topic model.  In this project, we will demonstrate this technique using the English Wikipedia corpus."

Abstract: In natural language processing, topic models are used to extract meaningful and human-interpretable topics from a corpus.  However, tuning topic models for large corpora can be time consuming and computationally expensive.  By monitoring topic coherence as a function of corpus size, we can determine how to efficiently create a high quality topic model.  In this project, we will demonstrate this technique using the English Wikipedia corpus.
